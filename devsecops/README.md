The AWS Copilot CLI is a tool for developers to create, release and manage production ready containerized applications on Amazon ECS and AWS Fargate.
From getting started, pushing to a test environment and releasing to production, Copilot helps you through the entire life of your app development.

Got a Dockerfile and some code? Get it up and running on ECS in under 10 minutes, with just one command. Ready to take that app to production? Spin up new environments and a continuous delivery pipeline without having to leave your terminal. Find a bug? Tail your logs and deploy with one tool.

Use Copilot to:

- Organize all your related micro-services in one application
- Set up test and production environments, across regions and accounts
- Set up production-ready, scalable ECS services and infrastructure
- Set up CI/CD Pipelines for all of the micro-services
- Monitor and debug your services from your terminal

## Getting started üå±

Make sure you have the AWS command line tool installed and have already run `aws configure` before you start.

To get a sample app up and running in one command, run the following manually:

```sh
$ mkdir -p /path/to/project
$ cd /path/to/project
$ copilot init --app <project_name>      \
  --svc api                              \
  --svc-type 'Load Balanced Web Service' \
  --dockerfile '/path/to/Dockerfile'     \
  --deploy
```

To create a new environment, run the following command:

```sh
$ copilot env init --name <env_name> --profile <profile_name> --yes
(profile_name default is `default`)

```

This will create a VPC, Application Load Balancer, an Amazon ECS Service with the sample app running on AWS Fargate. This process will take around 8 minutes to complete - at which point you'll get a URL for your sample app running!

## Cleaning up üßπ

Once you're finished playing around with this project, you can delete it and all the AWS resources associated it by running `copilot app delete`.

## Make

To get an application installation in one command, run the following:

```sh
make
```

To clean up this project, you can delete it and all the AWS resouces associated it by running `make clean`.

## We need your feedback üôè

The AWS Copilot CLI is in beta, meaning that you can expect our command names to be stable as well as the shape of our
infrastructure patterns. However, we want to know what works, what doesn't work, and what you want!
